# Claire - Smart Assistant for the paralyzed

Paralyzed people are unable to move or communicate effectively and are highly dependent on others. They can only use a limited number of muscles including the muscles in their eyes and eyelids. This project proposes a Smart Assistant controlled using iris movements like gaze left, right, and up.

Control home appliances like light, fan etc or facilitate a conversation using commonly used phrases which the app reads out aloud. All using **iris movements.**

Because of a low initial setup cost of $3 and availability of a smartphone in almost all households, this project can be leveraged as a cost-effective and highly accessible method, and extended to practically every household in a country like India.

Hardware: EM relay switch Y32F-SS-105HM and ESP8266 wifi module.<br>
Built with TensorFlow, and React Native.
